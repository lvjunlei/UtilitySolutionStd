	/**
	 * A BasicSourceMapConsumer instance represents a parsed source map which we can
	 * query for information about the original file positions by giving it a file
	 * position in the generated source.
	 *
	 * The only parameter is the raw source map (either as a JSON string, or
	 * already parsed to an object). According to the spec, source maps have the
	 * following attributes:
	 *
	 *   - version: Which version of the source map spec this map is following.
	 *   - sources: An array of URLs to the original source files.
	 *   - names: An array of identifiers which can be referrenced by individual mappings.
	 *   - sourceRoot: Optional. The URL root from which all sources are relative.
	 *   - sourcesContent: Optional. An array of contents of the original source files.
	 *   - mappings: A string of base64 VLQs which contain the actual mappings.
	 *   - file: Optional. The generated file this source map is associated with.
	 *
	 * Here is an example source map, taken from the source map spec[0]:
	 *
	 *     {
	 *       version : 3,
	 *       file: "out.js",
	 *       sourceRoot : "",
	 *       sources: ["foo.js", "bar.js"],
	 *       names: ["src", "maps", "are", "fun"],
	 *       mappings: "AA,AB;;ABCDE;"
	 *     }
	 *

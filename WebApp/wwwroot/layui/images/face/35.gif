	/**
	 * This is an implementation of binary search which will always try and return
	 * the index of the closest element if there is no exact hit. This is because
	 * mappings between original and generated line/col pairs are single points,
	 * and there is an implicit region between each of them, so a miss just means
	 * that you aren't on the very start of a region.
	 *
	 * @param aNeedle The element you are looking for.
	 * @param aHaystack The array that is being searched.
	 * @param aCompare A function which takes the needle and an element in the
	 *     array and returns -1, 0, or 1 depending on whether the needle is less
	 *     than, equal to, or greater than the element, respectively.
	 * @param aBias Either 'binarySearch.GREATEST_LOWER_BOUND' or
	 *     'binarySearch.LEAST_UPPER_BOUND'. Specifies whether to return the
	 *     closest element that is smaller than or greater than the one we are
	 *     searching for, respectively, if the exact element cannot be found.
	 *     Defaults to 'binarySearch.GREATEST_LOWER_BOUND'.
